tools to analyze the open-memory-box website
https://open-memory-box.de
The Website offers digitized versions of private 8mm films from the former GDR.
The Website do not offer much tools to see and understand how the films are taged and ordered. 
But the site offers an undocumented json-file with a lot of information about the material.
Feel free to play with the tools and explore the metadata of the open-memory-box
